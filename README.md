# Embedded Linux

Hello, and welcome to Josh Simons's repository for the embedded linux class.  This repository will be used as an example of ways to maintain a code base while working on a project. This is **NOT** the Embedded Linux class itself.  That is hosted on Google Classroom.  Please contact Josh Simons: "simonsj [at] newpaltz [dot] edu" if you are in the class, but do not have the classroom code.

# Branch Notes

**blinkTemp:** This branch is to integrate the DH11 (or DH22 in my case) Temperature and humidity sensor into the project. temp.py should serve as a simple test to get the sensor readings to output into the shell. blinkTemp.py should merge this functionality with blink.py.
