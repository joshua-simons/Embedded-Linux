# Embedded Linux

Hello, and welcome to Josh Simons's repository for the embedded linux class.  This repository will be used as an example of ways to maintain a code base while working on a project. This is **NOT** the Embedded Linux class itself.  That is hosted on Google Classroom.  Please contact Josh Simons: "simonsj [at] newpaltz [dot] edu" if you are in the class, but do not have the classroom code.

# Branch Notes

**blinker:** This branch adds switch functionality where a button press will trigger the LED to blink.  The LED blink timing was also altered to make a more rapid blink.  I am considering using a lower resistance LED to make the LED brighter.
